Docker installation on Windows
- if Docker is restarting and docker logs shows:  standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
-- run dos2unix.exe on docker/entrypoint.sh and docker/vhost.conf
-- rebuild the docker image
-- remove the docker container
-- start the docker container again
- project files have to be placed somewhere outside of the Users home directory, because of reasons. Docker will not mount the volumes required to run the webserver.
-- I suggest putting the project folder into C://www
